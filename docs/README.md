# Getting started with Ansible on Microsoft Azure

### Prerequisites

Microsoft Azure Account: You will need a valid and active Azure account for the Azure labs. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/).

## Setting up the environment

Using the Azure Resource Manager modules requires authenticating with the Azure API. You can choose from two authentication strategies:

- [Active Directory Username/Password](#active-directory-username-password)
- [Service Principal Credentials](#service-principal-credentials)


#### Step 1: Create Azure service principal

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/teemu-u/ansible-msworkshop/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
